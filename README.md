This Blender addon allows for the simulation of Lidar, Camera, and IMU data.

## Features

- Easily add new Lidar scanners by implementing a function and specifying the required parameters.

## TODOs

- Implement automatic path generation.
- Fix the issue with scanning along the Z-axis, which is currently not accurate.
- Implement IMU noise generation: [IMU Noise Model](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/IMU-Noise-Model).
- Add more Lidar scanners.
- Clean up the code.
- Make a tutorial
- framerate is currently calculated wrong
- create tutorial on how to set this up and use it
